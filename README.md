# LQR-Tracking-Multi-agent-System-Consensus
LQR is an ideal optimal control method which allows the controller performs effectively under the minimum cost defined by some factors. Multi-agent system consensus control is an useful strategy for coordinating multiple agents' state. Due to the fact the network has first order property, in consensus control process, there will not be oscillation and the convergence will be smooth. Inspired by the paper "Distributed cooperative control of autonomous multi-agent UAV systems using smooth control", a method combining LQR tracking and leader-follower based consensus control is applied to control a 5-cart system to move in a sinusoidal motion pattern.
